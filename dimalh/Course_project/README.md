# Course project -IOT_UART

Course project is a university laboratory project for PIC32 WiFire kit written in C language for studying basic configuring and usage of UART and SPI protocols.

In project was implemented controlling an angle of the servo through UART and displaying setted angle of the servo on OLED SPI display. Using COM port terminal you can turn servo to one of two defined mode by sending '1', '2' . It uses 115200 baud rate.
