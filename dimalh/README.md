lab3_ADC_PWM.X is a university laboratory project for PIC32 WiFire kit written in C language for studying basic usage of interrupts of microcontroller.

in this program you can hear different sound of piezo buzzer. If you want to change the type of sound, so you have to change frequency. if you will rotate Potentiometer, you will change frequency, so you change type of sound in the piezo buzzer.
